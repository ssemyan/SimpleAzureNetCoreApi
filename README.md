# SimpleAzureNetCoreApi

This is just a simple .NET Core API that shows the basics to do CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete) for items in a SQL database. 

This samples uses the [localdb](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/sql-server-express-localdb?view=sql-server-ver15) version of Microsoft SQL. 

To set up, connect to a localdb and run the *DataSetup.sql* script. 

You can also use a regular SQL database. The connection string is set in *appsettings.json*
